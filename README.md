## Built With ðŸ› 

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - Coroutines is the Android team's recommended solution for asynchronous programming on Android
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - ViewModel is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way which allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - LiveData is lifecycle-aware observable data holder class for communicating between viewmodel and the view
  - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and provides a type and null safe way of interacting with views.
  - [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) - WorkManager makes it easy to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that are expected to run even if the app exits or the device restarts.
  - [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
  - [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - The Navigation Architecture Component simplifies implementing navigation, while also helping you visualize your app's navigation flow. 
- [Koin](https://doc.insert-koin.io/#/) - A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin 
- [ThreeTenABP](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP) - An adaptation of the JSR-310 backport for Android.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.

- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [Moshi Converter](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/moshi) - A Converter which uses Moshi for serialization to and from JSON.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android


## Architecture

The app uses [MVVM (Model View View-Model)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.
